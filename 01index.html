    <marquee>It has to be the time at the Botanical Gardens. Has to be. So this was like the first time that Emily and I dated...Being the 17 year old boy that I was on a date with you know, with you, and you know, you looked good and I like touching your butt as you know now and now let me do. Back then I guess it was too soon cause I tried, I tried to do it very casually. We were just walking through the flowers being all nice. I had my arm around your shoulder, then your waist, and then just butt. </marquee>
    
    <marquee scrolldelay="500"> And she’s like, “Woah, woah. Not super cool.” And I was like, “Okay. Alright.” And then I tried it again because I’m a fucking degenerate idiot. And I got what was coming to me; and I got SMACKED. In the face.</marquee>
